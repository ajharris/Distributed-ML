# Methodology

This document describes the methodology used in developing a Machine Learning based medical image analysis pipeline, including dataset handling, metadata schema definitions, preprocessing strategy, modeling pipelines, and reproducibility practices.

The project is designed to support **multiple medical imaging datasets** (e.g., NLST, COPDGene, LIDC-IDRI) under a **unified pipeline**. The goal is to allow standardized ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation while maintaining transparency and reproducibility.
