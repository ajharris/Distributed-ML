# 1. Project Overview

This research project uses large CT imaging datasets to study clinical, morphological, and predictive biomarkers in lung disease and lung cancer. Because these datasets differ widely in structure, imaging conventions, and clinical metadata, we adopt a **dataset-agnostic schema** that allows all data to be harmonized into a single consistent structure.

This methodology document serves as the foundation for:

- dataset ingestion (`src/ingest/`)
- feature extraction (`src/features/`)
- modeling (`src/modeling/`)
- evaluation (`src/eval/`)
- scientific documentation (`docs/`)
